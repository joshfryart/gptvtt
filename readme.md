# My Custom Fantasy Grounds Module

This custom module for Fantasy Grounds adds integration with the OpenAI API, allowing you to generate text responses to prompts using advanced machine learning models.

## Installation

1. Copy the `mycustommodule` subdirectory to the `modules` directory located in your Fantasy Grounds installation.
2. Open the `mycustommodule/config.xml` file and fill in the `openai_key` field with your OpenAI API authentication key. If you don't have a key, you can sign up for a free account and get one at https://beta.openai.com/signup/.
3. Launch Fantasy Grounds and enable the `mycustommodule` module in the "Modules" section of the main menu.

## Usage

This custom module adds new functionality to Fantasy Grounds for generating AI-generated text, both in chat messages and in the creation of journal entries and rollable tables.

To use the OpenAI API in your Fantasy Grounds game, select the "OpenAI" option from the extension drop-down menu in the chat window or in the Scenes, Actors, Items, Journal, or Rollable Tables sections of the Fantasy Grounds interface.

Once you've selected your desired destination, you'll be prompted to enter a prompt or query for the OpenAI API to generate a response. The AI will then generate a response based on your prompt, which will be inserted into the appropriate location in Fantasy Grounds.

Note that you will need an OpenAI API key to use this module, and that you'll need to have an active account with funding on the OpenAI website in order to generate responses. If you don't already have an account, you can sign up for one at https://beta.openai.com/signup/.
